            <h3>Jared</h3>
            <p>Jared is a young professional recently out of college working in IT at local credit union. He enjoys getting out in nature, hiking and exploring, on his days off. Also looks for activities and festivals to meet new people who share his interests.  Jared mostly uses his laptop to check for good hikes, the weather, and other outdoor activities, but likes to have access to his favorite sites for this when he’s headed out.</p>

            <h3>Sarah</h3>
            <p>Sarah is an active high schooler who loves being outside. She and her friends live in rural communities so, they are always looking for fun activities to do in their area. Exploring, taking pictures, and riding bikes in nature are some of her normal activities, so she uses her phone to access new places to go and what the weather should be once there.</p>
