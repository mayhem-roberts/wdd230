                    <h3>Relight the Night brings Yellowstone Hotel sign back to life</h3>
                    <p>A beacon of neon light that ushered rail passengers into the heart of Old Town Pocatello for decades, and then went dark for just as long, has recently come back to life. Though not in complete working order, the Hotel Yellowstone sign atop the Standrod-Daniels Building, popularly known as the Yellowstone Hotel building, is shining bright, once again welcoming visitors to Old Town Pocatello. “Dick and Ann Carroll, owners of the Yellowstone Hotel, have made the decision to find out what it would take to bring the sign back to life permanently,” said Randy Dixon, Relight the Night Committee chairman. “And they have the intention to light the sign every night if it is repaired, barring some astronomical repair price.”</p>
